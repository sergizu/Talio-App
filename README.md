## How to run it
When you want to run the program, you first have to start the server.
You can do this by following the following file path: server/src/main/java/server/Main.java.
Now right-click on the 'Main' java file and press run Main.main().

After you have started the server, you can run the client by following the following file path:
client/src/main/java/client/Main.java. Then right-click on the 'Main' java file and press run client.main().
A window should pop up in about 10 seconds after starting the client, which enables interaction with the application.
You are also able to run multiple clients at the same time by simply repeating the last step.

## How to contribute to it
Create an issue about it in gitlab, branch off of main and implement your changes in your branch.
