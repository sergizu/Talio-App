#### Meeting Organization 
_Pass_

Everyone knew who had what roles and it was clear from the beginning. Next time it could also be mentioned in the agenda itself (is not mandatory however).

#### Agenda 
_Good_

Good, sticked to it well and the point were logical. Agenda also followed the template which is nice to see. Next time a big agenda point could be broken down into smaller points, so the entire meeting is not "one big point".

#### Chair performance
_Excellent_

All points covered, took a leading role, and really took an initiative in the meeting. For example, asked note taker how much time was left over to make sure the meeting was going on pace. All of these things were great to see, nice job!

#### Time management
_Good_

The agenda itself was covered perfectly, so that was fine. However next time it might be nice to add some other smaller points that could be discussed, like the upcoming deadlines, the backlog etc. In the coming weeks there will be more points to talk about.

#### Minute taker performance
_Good_

Notes were very clear, good that there were entire sentences used. Also nice to see names used in the minutes!

#### Relation
_Good_

The meeting was centralized and clear, with everyone participating. Everyone was also respectfull and friendly.
