### Submission
_Pass_

The file is in the correct location and in the correct format (PDF).

### Backlog Structure
_Pass_

The structure of the backlog is ordered well, with the stakeholders clearly mentioned, followed by the terminology, after which the correctly prioritized user stories, together with the mockups. The stakeholders section is fine, however the role of the admin can be clarified (what do they manage exactly?). The terminology is looking good, nothing to add here. The user stories are also looking fine! However don't forget to mention the mockups in the user stories itself.



### Epics
_Insufficient_
The epics are currently not made according to the assignment, and thus are insufficient. (Don't use MOSCOW!). The first epic should be the "minimal application", which contain the user stories that are needed for the basic application to work correctly. After that there should be new epics for other big extra features, which are all accompanied by a corresponding description, their own user stories, and a mockup. The other epics (which are like bigger extra features)should also be in order of prioritization that you will implement them.



### User Stories
_Good_
The user stories are all in the correct format, which is good to see. They are focussed on the user perspective. They are relatively free of overlap, and are together very complete. The only missing thing is that they are not correctly categorized in their corresponding epic, but that should be done for the final backlog.

### Acceptance Criteria
_Very Good_
The user stores are small in size, and their effect is know so you know when a story is implemented. However some stories are vaguer/have a larger size, which could be improved in the final backlog.
