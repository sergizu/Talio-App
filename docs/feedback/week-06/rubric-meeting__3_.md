#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chair: Yuraj Mangalgi
Minute taker: Konstantin Teplykh


#### Agenda 
_Very Good_

Agenda follows the template well and there are good points chosen! Really like how the action points are accompanied by a good description. Onyl thing to improve is maybe removing the "template agenda" title from the agenda.



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Excellent_

The notes are put in the agenda file well and there is a good amount of them. Only significant meeting details were written down which is good to see. It's also very nice to see a list under "divide tasks" where the tasks are clearly defined next to the names!


#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

Chair was leading the meeting well and made sure all topics were covered well. Also made sure everybody was involved in the meeting which is nice to see. After the demo the meeting fell apart a bit, and it should be the chair's responsibility to keep close the meeting accordingly.



#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

Everyone was listened to and was able to give their opinion during discussions. Nice to see constructive and friendly meetings! Some points outside of the agenda were discussed, which is fine, but should try to stick to the agenda when possible. The chair did pick it back up which is really nice to see!



#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Good_

You presented the main branch and showed off the application. There was progress from last week, which is nice to see. It was possible to add lists and there was synchronization between client instances. It would have been nice to see the application a bit more functional next week. The team is on track in order to create a working application at the project's end!
