#### Meeting Organization
_Pass_

Chair: Aadesh Ramai
Minute taker: Sergiu-Nicolae Stancu

Mentioned in agenda and different people!

#### Agenda 
_Excellent_

Uploaded on time, followed the template, and the points are clear + have a good description! Keep it up like this.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Good_

The notes are merged into the agends file, and there are a good amount of them. However there are some unnesary notes, like: "We also went over advanced feature descriptions, but unfortunately due to the time we couldnâ€™t manage to brainstorm them all". Notes like this are not important and can be omitted. Also it could be a little clearer what tasks each person has been given, and put in the notes themselves what the task is, instead of referencing to another document.

#### Chair performance
_Very Good_

The chair made sure all topcis were covered for an appropriate amount of time. Sometimes the meeting went a little "freestyle", where things outside of the agenda were discussed, which is fine, but should not happen too much.
Chair did ask if everyone had anything to add, which is also good to hear!



#### Attitude & Relation
_Very Good_

The team took ownership of the meeting well. Everyone was active in the meeting, but sometimes not everyone was equally involved in the meeting, where sometimes people were working on their laptops while others were having discussions, which comes across a little uncoordinated. Try to make sure everyone is on the same pace (which can be the chairs responsibility). Otherwise a great meeting!



#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Very Good_

You presented the application well, which was an agenda point which is good. The changes were merged into main, and there was good progress from last week. There is even almost synchronization working already, which is nice to see so early on! I think you are well on track to create a good working application.
