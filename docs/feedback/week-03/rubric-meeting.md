#### Meeting Organization
Chair: Stancu Sergiu-Nicolae

Minute taker: Dzintars EmÄ«ls

_Pass_

Different chair and minute taker, and they were chosen beforehand. (It is also nice to see that it was written down in the agenda!)



#### Agenda 
_Very Good_

The agenda was added on time, and follows the template which is both good to see! The individual points are also clear and well chosen. Again nice to see the chair and minute taker mentioned here already. In the next weeks it would be nice to have a point for a short demonstration of the application, so I can see your progress on a weekly basis. To improve the agenda, the small description of the points could be a little more detailed/in depth of what is going to be discussed. 



#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker
_Very Good_

I already gave some feedback on the notes last week, but this is the official feedback for last week's notes. The notes have been merged in the agenda file, which is good to see. The notes are detailed and cover all important points. However for next time, they could be reduced as they don't need to be this detailed. The concrete action items, together with who is responsible and the deadline, is amazing to see clearly written down in a table! Keep it up like this.



#### Chair performance
_Good_

The chair led the meeting and made sure that all topcis were covered, and for an appropiate amount of time. However sometimes the meeting was not very central, which should be the chair's responsibility. Also there were some points covered that were outside the agenda, which should ideally be talked about at the end of the meeting.

#### Attitude & Relation
_Good_

You all took ownership of the meeting and everybody was participating, which is nice to see. The meeting was sometimes abit chaotic and not central, which could be improved upon next meeting. Other than that, everyone's comments were taken into account, which is good to see!


#### Potentially Shippable Product
_Sufficient_

You presented the current state of the application when I asked about it, and for next time it would be nice to have it as an agenda point. For now this section is sufficient (which is the most you could have gotten for this week!), but next week there should be a "working" (ofcourse not finished) application, on the main branch, with changes compared to last week. Make sure everyone is on the same page and able show off the main branch.
